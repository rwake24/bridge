# Workspaces & Agents

## Workspaces

Each bot gets a workspace directory at `~/.copilot-bridge/workspaces/<botname>/`. This is the default working directory for DM conversations with that bot.

Workspaces are auto-created when the bridge starts and detects a bot without one. They contain:

```
~/.copilot-bridge/workspaces/agent-name/
├── AGENTS.md        # Agent instructions (auto-generated from template, customizable)
├── MEMORY.md        # Persistent memory across sessions (managed by the agent)
└── .env             # Environment variables loaded at session start
```

### Custom working directories

For group channels or project-specific DMs, override the workspace via `workingDirectory` in [config.json](configuration.md#channels). The same bot can serve multiple channels, each pointed at a different directory.

## Agent templates

Templates in the repo define the baseline instructions for agents:

```
templates/
├── admin/
│   └── AGENTS.md    # Template for admin bots
└── agents/
    └── AGENTS.md    # Template for non-admin bots
```

On startup, the bridge copies these to `~/.copilot-bridge/templates/` (mtime-based sync — newer source overwrites destination). When a new workspace is created, its `AGENTS.md` is rendered from the appropriate template with variables like `{{botName}}`, `{{workspacePath}}`, and `{{adminBotName}}` filled in.

You can customize the deployed templates at `~/.copilot-bridge/templates/` without modifying the repo. Your edits won't be overwritten unless the repo template is newer.

### Admin vs non-admin agents

- **Admin bots** (`"admin": true` in config) get the admin template, which includes instructions for managing the bridge: creating agents, editing config, restarting the service.
- **Non-admin bots** get the agents template, which includes an "Out of Scope — Defer to Admin" section listing tasks they should redirect to the admin bot.

## Environment variables (.env)

Each workspace can have a `.env` file that's loaded into the agent's shell environment at session start:

```bash
# ~/.copilot-bridge/workspaces/alice/.env
APP_TOKEN=secret-value-here
APP_URL=https://my-app.local
```

### How it works

- Variables are parsed and injected into `process.env` before the Copilot CLI subprocess spawns
- A mutex serializes session creation so concurrent agent startups don't leak env vars across agents
- After the subprocess spawns, the original `process.env` is restored — other agents never see another agent's vars

### Security guidance

The agent template instructs bots to treat `.env` as **write-only**:

- **Never read or display `.env` contents** — this keeps secret values out of the LLM context
- **Append-only pattern** for adding new keys:
  ```bash
  grep -q '^APP_TOKEN=' .env 2>/dev/null || echo "APP_TOKEN=" >> .env
  ```
- The user then fills in the actual secret value directly (not through chat)

## DM auto-discovery

On startup, each bot queries the Mattermost API for its existing DM channels. New DMs are registered automatically — no config entry needed. The bot uses its default workspace, `triggerMode: "all"`, and `threadedReplies: false`.

When a user messages a bot for the first time (creating a new DM), the bridge discovers it via the WebSocket event and registers it on the fly.

## Session lifecycle

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `/new` | Destroys the current session and creates a fresh one |
| `/reload` | Detaches and re-attaches the same session (re-reads AGENTS.md, workspace config, MCP servers) |
| `/resume` | Lists past sessions for this workspace |
| `/resume <id>` | Switches to a specific past session |

Sessions persist in SQLite and resume across bridge restarts. The admin bot receives a "🔄 Gateway restarted." notice and is nudged to continue any interrupted work.

## Adding a new agent

The recommended flow is to ask the admin bot in chat. It will:

1. Collect the agent name, purpose, and bot token
2. Add the bot to `config.json` (with a backup)
3. Create the workspace directory
4. Write a customized `AGENTS.md`
5. Restart the bridge

You can also do this manually — see the admin template (`templates/admin/AGENTS.md`) for the detailed steps.
